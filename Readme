This project demonstrates how to build an AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using “Amazon Bedrock”.

~ Here's a quick overview of what we're building today:
I am about to build a chatbot that's trained on your personal documents. When you send a message to your completed chatbot, three things will happen behind the scenes:

1- The chatbot uses an AI model to understand your question and figure out what information it needs to answer it.
2- The AI model sends a request for information it needs to your Knowledge Base, which is where you process and store your personal documents.
3- The AI model transforms the raw data (e.g. paragraphs of text) from your Knowledge Base into a proper response, which gets sent back to you.

~ Built using AWS Console (no coding required).
Steps Implimented:

1- Login from IAM User
2- Create an S3 Bucket & Upload Files
3- Setting up a Knowledge Base in Amazon Bedrock
4- Connect Datasource to Knowledge Base
5- Get Access to AI-models
6- Sync your Knowledge Base
7- Chat with your Chatbot
